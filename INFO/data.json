After making its debut as a pilot episode on Comedy Playhouse, the show ran for a total of seven seasons until 1975. Six years later, ITV picked up where it left off with the sitcom and gave it the name Till Death.... A sequel titled \"In Sickness and in Health\" was produced by the BBC from 1985 to 1992. Till Death Us Do Part was written by Johnny Speight and centered on the East End Garnett family. The show's father, Alf Garnett, is a reactionary white working-class man who harbors racist and anti-socialist ideas. Johnny Speight was the show's creator. Dandy Nichols was the actress who played his patient and kind wife Else, while Una Stubbs was the one who portrayed their daughter Rita. Mike Rawlins, Rita's intelligent but somewhat slacker of a husband, is a communist. Mitchell portrayed the role of Alf Garnett on stage and television up until 1998, when Speight passed away. Over the course of his career, Alf Garnett became a well-known figure in the culture of the United Kingdom. In addition to the spin-off film In Sickness and in Health, the original film Till Death Us Do Part has been remade in a number of countries, including the United States of America, Germany, and Brazil. It is believed that a good number of episodes from the first three series no longer exist since they were destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s in accordance with the protocol that was in place at the time.",

In a manner comparable to Tales from the Darkside, Monsters had the same producer and in some ways surpassed the show. Nonetheless, it varied in a few ways. In contrast to Tales, which occasionally featured science fiction and fantasy tales, this series was primarily horror. As the title suggests, each episode of Monsters focused on a different monster, ranging from a mechanical puppet from a fictional children's television show to mutant, armed lab rodents. Similar to Tales, the stories in Monsters were rarely conventional action storylines and frequently featured an ironic twist in which a character's arrogance or avarice led to horrific consequences. Adding to this was a sense of humor that is typically absent from horror productions, which in some circumstances may have served to lighten the mood of the audience, but in most cases contributed to the overall unsettling nature of the production.",

Cate Blanchett and Ernie Dingo starred in each of the show's thirteen episodes during its run. In some regions of the world, the program was also referred to as Burned Bridge. The television show Heartland is about the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of an Aboriginal girl and the questions raised about the culpability of the girl's lover, who has been charged with her murder. It is also a love tale between two of the people who are persuaded of his innocence; their developing relationship must endure the hatred from both the white community and the black community, as well as the hurdles presented by their various backgrounds, views, and cultures. Heartland is about the people who live in a seaside village and their struggle to reorganize their own way of life. The story takes place in a tiny coastal hamlet and is surrounded by the upheavals of a murder case and a budding romance. Their efforts, in spite of the challenges they face, to rebuild their sense of self-worth in order to create a brighter future for themselves. The character of Elizabeth Ashton, a writer who moves to a tiny coastal hamlet, serves as the focal point for a number of the other plot aspects. There is a level of mistrust directed toward the newbie who is oblivious to any preexisting racial issues in the community. Because of her naivet\u00e9, she was able to form a friendship with a local Aborigine named Vincent Burunga. Phil McCarthy, a local police officer, is a potential suitor for Ashton but is antagonistic toward her association with Burunga. This hostility stems not just from McCarthy's status as a potential rival for Ashton's affections but also from his racial prejudice.",

Schwartz also serves as the show's executive producer. Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., Jim Backus, Natalie Schafer, Tina Louise, and Russell Johnson were among the cast members of the situation comedy series. Dawn Wells also appeared on the show. Beginning on September 26, 1964 and running through September 4, 1967, it was broadcast on the CBS network for a total of three seasons. The show initially featured the comedic exploits of seven castaways as they fought to live on the island on which they had been stranded. Philip Morris & Company and Procter & Gamble were the companies that sponsored the show when it first aired. The tensions between the many castaways and their unsuccessful attempts to escape their predicament are the primary focus of the majority of the show's episodes. There were a total of 98 episodes produced for the television series Gilligan's Island. The first season of the show was produced in black-and-white and consisted of a total of 36 episodes. After then, these programs received a color makeover for syndication. Color photography was utilized for the production of the show's second and third seasons, as well as all three television movie sequels. The show was successful in the ratings during its initial run, and it continued to grow in popularity during the decades that it was broadcast in syndication, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s when many markets broadcasted it in the late afternoon or evening after school had let out. Today, the titular character of the television show Gilligan is widely acknowledged as an important figure in American popular culture.",

The show ran for three seasons, and the last episode aired on June 2, 2006, in Mexico. In June 2006, C\u00f3digo Postal, a new show on Televisa, took the place of Rebelde. The series takes place at the Elite Way School, a prestigious private boarding high school in Mexico City. The main plot revolves around a group of students forming a pop band. There are also subplots involving the school's teachers and the parents of the students. Fresa characters often use English words and phrases out of context, which is one thing that makes the show stand out. One interesting thing about the show is that the actors who play the band members are in a real band called RBD and play most of the music on the show. They have done very well for themselves, becoming one of the most popular acts in Latin America and traveling the world. Rebelde was on the air from March 21, 2005, until December 15, 2006. The show was also shown in 65 other countries, including Serbia, Peru, and Romania on Acasa TV, Brazil, Spain on Antena 3, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and, starting in September 2009, Slovakia on TV Doma, Croatia on Nova TV, and Albania on Vizion Plus.",

Jon Benjamin, among other Soup2nuts Productions alumni, as high school students Abby and Kevin, and follows their lives as well as that of other residents of O'Grady, a fictional town beset by \"The Weirdness\" on a regular basis. The Weirdness has an odd effect on its people, such as projecting their private thoughts in bubbles over their heads or generating clones of themselves every time they become upset. The plot is explained through the show's logo's random alterations. Although The N no longer broadcasts reruns of the show, episodes are still available on the network's website. Episodes can also be purchased on iTunes and Amazon Instant Video. On July 14, 2013, TeenNick resumed airing reruns of the show.",

Wei Young has trouble fitting in because she hates the enemy who destroyed her kingdom and doesn't have the expected feminine graces of her time.

And it's her wisdom and kindness that make two very different men want to be with her. Tuoba Jun is a well-educated, kind, and popular prince who is liked by everyone, including the king. He falls in love with Wei Young. And his younger brother Tuoba Yu, the cold, dangerous, and emotionally scarred prince who really wants to run the empire and sees the smart Wei Young as his tool and his older brother as his rival, is also in competition with him.

In the show, John Simm, Marc Warren, Max Beesley, and Philip Glenister play four middle-aged friends who get together in a villa in Majorca to celebrate their friend Alvo's early retirement. But when Alvo is killed, the group gets caught up in the world of crime and corrupt police. The series was supposed to be about a rock band at first, but the idea was changed because bands have been \"done to death.\" After some terrestrial networks showed interest, British Sky Broadcasting decided to make the show. In May 2010, the movie was filmed all over the island of Majorca. It cost about four million euros and took 44 days to make. The main themes are friendship and getting older. Glenister said it was about getting older and \"getting closer to death.\" Three 30-second ads for the show were made by photographer David LaChapelle. Mad Dogs debuted with 1.61 million viewers, making it Sky1's 17th highest-rated show ever, and critics liked what they saw. They saw similarities with British gangster movies, especially Sexy Beast from 2000.",

At this time, he talked to the programmers at Public Broadcasting Service about making a half-hour wildlife show. It would be the first show to focus solely on the plants and animals of North America. In1982, PBS bought the rights to broadcast Marty Stouffer's show Wild America. The show became one of the most popular on PBS because of its uncompromising presentation of nature and its extensive use of film techniques including slow motion and close-ups. Stouffer made $135,000 per show from PBS. The show was produced between 1982 and 1994. The series is no longer on PBS, but reruns are still shown on commercial television in most of the United States. In1997, Warner Brothers released a full-length movie called Wild America, which was loosely based on the lives of Marty Stouffer and his brothers, Mark and Marshall.",

The Ben Stiller Show was different from most sketch comedy shows because it didn't have a studio audience or a laugh track.

DVD, Bleasdale recounts an unintentional meeting with Hatton before the series, who indicates that he has caught wind of Bleasdale's intentions but does not mind as long as the actor playing him is \"handsome.\" The letters \"GBH\" are commonly used to relate to the criminal charge of grievous bodily harm; nevertheless, the real aim of the letters is to stand for Great British Holiday.",

The show aimed to capitalize on the early 1990s infatuation with virtual reality and the success of Power Rangers. The show included early CGI and video effects blended with Japanese stock material from three separate Metal Hero series: Superhuman Machine Metalder, Dimensional Warrior Spielban, and Space Sheriff Shaider. This tokusatsu adaptation was one of the first to adopt an adaptation approach like this, which combines numerous shows into a single one, and it was initially used in anime series like Robotech and Voltron. The copyright for VR Troopers was transferred to SCG Power Rangers on May7, 2010. Saban's VR Troopers was the first \"sister show\" to the most popular \"action fighting kid show\" at the time, Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. In a similar vein, Toei Company LTD. adapted a Japanese tokusatsu children's show for the US market.. The series was deemed popular, though not as successful as the Power Ranger franchise. Unfortunately for the series, the Japanese footage was quickly exhausted due to extreme circumstances where many tokusatsu scenarios were combined in one episode to the extent that stock video had to be reused several times throughout the series. A similar situation occurred with another Saban cartoon called Big Bad Beetleborgs, which was a hit but ended quickly owing to a lack of footage. Both of these shows are based on the original Metal Heroes manga and anime from Japan. Because of the series' success, toy and video game manufacturers followed suit.",

The sixth season's final episode, which aired on March 8, 2008, marked the conclusion of production. Endurance reruns continue to air in the United States on Hub Network, Discovery Kids' successor, until July 22, 2013.

The sitcom debuted on WGN America on September 13, 2010, and has continued to air there since then. The show was well-known for the moral messages that it conveyed. For instance, the characters didn't use drugs and were active members of the community, thus they avoided that lifestyle choice. The use of martial arts was frequently featured throughout the show, both as the primary instrument used by law enforcement and occasionally as a technique used by Walker and company to reach out to the community.

While Harlan Judd and his workers are able to retrieve money for victims and investigate individuals for customers with the use of high-tech devices, they are nevertheless able to keep a great deal of information hidden from one another. ABC made the announcement in May 2005 that they would not be airing the remaining episodes of the show until at the earliest, the month of June. This came after they had already rescheduled the sixth episode twice. Later on, it was revealed that the show would not be renewed for a second season and that the remaining episodes would not be televised at any point in the future. This program was taken up by the TV2 channel in New Zealand, and beginning in the second half of 2005, all twelve episodes of the series were broadcast on that station. Soon later, these episodes were made available online through BitTorrent. The sitcom was also broadcast in an incomplete form on the Singaporean television station Mediacorp Channel 5, with the pilot episode as well as episodes 106 to 112 omitted from the broadcast. One of the exceptions was episode number 111, which was broadcast as the fifth episode. In 2006, the program was also broadcast in its entirety on the cable television channel Canal Jimmy in France. At the beginning of 2008, the entirety of the program was broadcast on the television channel TVN 7 in Poland. In 2007, episodes of the series were broadcast on the Nine Network in Australia.",

As stories of everything from government cover-ups and smuggling to theft and murder begin to unravel in the aftermath of the disaster, a number of surprising truths emerge. The story is ostensibly resolved in a metafictional fashion with a flashback to an occurrence in the service station and the swatting of a wasp, which precipitates the first crash, thus allowing the protagonists to continue on their trips. The wasp appears regularly as a motif and topic throughout the series. Collision's original British broadcast was cut from five hours to three and a half hours. The abridged version was shown on PBS's Masterpiece Contemporary in the United States, on ABC1 in Australia, and on the Region 1 DVD release. Collision premiered in its original version of five 45-minute episodes on Foxtel and Austar's W Channel in Australia on Tuesday, March 15th, 2011.",

Each villain's story has more and more crazy technology, skills, and situations, and each episode ends with a different take on the famous \"meddling kids\" line.

The programme seeks out new singing talent by holding public auditions, and then pits those singers against one another in a competition for viewers' votes. It is based on the original version of The X Factor, which was broadcast in the United Kingdom. Voting takes place over the phone, the Internet, and via SMS text messages, and the winner receives a recording contract with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Music. In seasons one and two, the recording contract is worth $5 million, and in season three, the recording contract is for $1 million. The winner of the first season was Melanie Amaro, while the winner of the second season was Tate Stevens. The first broadcast of the show in the United States was on September 21, 2011, and it has continued to air every year from September through December since then. The performances of the candidates are evaluated by a panel of judges that are employed by the series. Each participant will be placed in one of the following four categories: One category includes group acts, while the others are classified according to age or gender. For instance, the categories for the third season are girls, boys, groups, and individuals older than 25 years old. Each judge is given a category to which they are assigned and acts as a mentor to the contestants competing in that category. This includes assisting contestants with making decisions regarding song selection, styling, and staging, as well as judging contestants competing in other categories following each live performance. They compete against one another in order to achieve their ultimate goal of having one of the contestants in their category emerge victorious and earning them the title of winning judge.",

Eight episodes into the first season, he was joined by Jack Kelly as his brother Bart, and from then on, Garner and Kelly switched protagonists from week to week, occasionally joining up for the unusual two-brother episode. The Mavericks were Texas poker players who traveled throughout the American Old West and on Mississippi riverboats, continually getting into and out of life-threatening situations involving money, women, or both. They would often have to evaluate a money windfall against a moral quandary. Because both Mavericks were deeply ethical, their consciences often took precedence over their finances. When Garner quit the show after the third season owing to a legal dispute, Roger Moore was cast as their cousin Beau Maverick. Brent Maverick, a third Maverick sibling, was played by Robert Colbert later in the fourth season. No more than two of the series' leads ever appeared in the same episode, and frequently only one.",

It is based on the Korean folk tale Prince Hodong and the Princess of Nakrang, which tells about the Nakrang Kingdom and how it fell apart. According to the story, there was a famous drum called the jamyeonggo, which means \"the drum that beats by itself.\" This mysterious drum had the power to automatically sound an alarm whenever enemies attacked its kingdom. The drum's sound made nearby countries, like the warrior state of Goguryeo, think twice before attacking Nakrang. Hodong, a prince from Goguryeo, went to Nakrang with the goal of destroying the drum. But the prince fell in love with the princess of Nakrang, which was a surprise. For her love, the princess decided to betray her country by tearing off the drum. Because of this, her country fell apart, and she was killed. Prince Hodong held her body and cried over her death. The drama series, on the other hand, adds a new twist by making the drum a person. Ja-myung, the Nakrang Kingdom princess's hidden sister, plays the role of the drum. Ra-hee grows up as the princess of Nakrang, where everyone loves her. Ja-myung, on the other hand, survives an attempt on her life and lives as a commoner. Prince Hodong is from the Goguryeo Kingdom, which is at war with Nakrang.

The voice of the Hulk in the authentic version from Marvel was provided by Lou Ferrigno, who played the role of the Hulk in the live-action television series produced by Universal in the 1970s. It wasn't uncommon for characters from other Marvel cartoons from the same era to make guest cameos in this show. UPN determined that the first season of the show was too dark, so they decided to change the concept of the show for the second season. Additionally, in order to give \"female viewers a chance,\" the network ordered that She-Hulk be made a regular co-star on the show. As a direct consequence of this development, the title of the show was changed to its current iteration, The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk.

The show's treatment of the ethical dilemmas that arise in intelligence work and its examination of current international issues were both contentious. After Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network plans a lethal strike on the West, Beckner wrote a pilot script for a re-invented CIA tasked with the \"War on Terror.\" It was scheduled to premiere on September 18, 2001, however the 9/11 events caused CBS to postpone the premiere and air a later episode instead of holding the pilot. The first episode of the first season was rerun as episode number three. When the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks occurred, \"The Agency\" was one of the most topical offerings on network television at the time. This transformed how Americans saw current entertainment. This new American perspective on global issues was enthusiastically embraced by the series' creators, but CBS decided to cancel the show shortly after the conclusion of the second season.",

Madison was a hard-hitting teen drama with episodes that lasted 30 minutes. The show dealt with serious problems that teenagers face and gave them real solutions. Under the name \"Working It Out at Madison,\" the show was originally made to be used in classrooms as a learning tool. However, networks fell in love with its gritty story lines and great acting, and the show was picked up. In 1995, 1996, and 1997, the producers were up for the Gemini Award for Best Dramatic Series in Canada. A lot of the actors in Madison went on to have successful acting careers: At age 22, Joely Collins won the \"Best Actress\" Gemini Award in Canada in 1996. Barry Pepper went on to work with Tom Hanks in \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"The Green Mile.\" He also worked with Will Smith in \"Enemy of the State,\" and in 2011 he won an Emmy Award for his role as Bobby in \"The Kennedy.\" Will Sasso, another Madison actor, was a regular on \"MadTV\" for several seasons and played Curly in the 2012 movie version of \"The Three Stooges.\" Enuka Okuma is an actress who has been in the hit show\"24\" and is now a regular on the cop drama \"Rookie Blue.\"",

These are just a handful of the out-of-the-way locales that romantic explorers go to in order to be intimate with their significant others. There are plenty more. However, very few people anticipate that the outcome will be that they will visit the emergency room. This brand-new series was brought to life for Discovery Fit & Health by GRB Entertainment, the production company that was responsible for the success of the show UNTOLD STORIES OF THE ER. The series documents the real-life stories of what happens when a little action leads to a medical crisis, and it often features hilarious outcomes. This series illustrates how loving couples cope when sex goes outrageously wrong by retelling the stories of actual couples who, in the heat of the moment, got themselves into a fix and needed a doctor to fix it. The stories are retold by emergency room physicians and the actual couples who got themselves into a fix and needed a doctor to fix it.",

The series stars John Thaw as the working-class barrister James Kavanagh QC from Bolton, Greater Manchester. Later episodes, as his parents' health deteriorates, including a conversation with a coworker who assumed Kavanagh was originally from Yorkshire, reveal this. The show focused on both his legal battles and domestic issues, including the passing of his loyal and adoring wife. Later, he starts dating a fellow attorney. In court, Kavanagh is typically shown representing a client who first appears to be on the verge of conviction, however on occasion, Kavanagh is seen in a prosecuting capacity. Kavanagh frequently faces cases in the main narrative that have a subtext of racism, sexism, or other prejudice. In supporting stories, humor was provided by Jeremy, a pretentious barrister in chambers, for his conceit and egotism. In the courtroom, Kavanagh's adversaries cannot intimidate him with threats or bribes because he will not tolerate injustice.",

The concept of the series was comparable to two other popular ABC shows produced by Aaron Spelling: The Love Boat and Hotel, in that it featured high-profile celebrity guest appearances each week, such Ginger Rogers and Cyd Charisse. Glitter, unlike the other series, was not a ratings hit. The first three episodes aired in September1984, followed by a hiatus until December1984, when three more episodes were broadcast. The series was canceled as the ratings did not improve. The final eight episodes aired on ABC late-night in December 1985.

The episode \"Celebrity Deathmatch Hits Germany,\" which broadcast on June 21, 2001, was a one-off special that was not included toward the final episode tally. Stone Cold Steve Austin, a professional wrestler, provided the voice for his animated persona in his role as a guest commentator. MTV made the announcement that a film adaptation of the series will be in the works at the beginning of 2003; however, the film adaptation was scrapped by the time the year was over. As a part of their \"Sic 'Em Friday\" programming block in 2005, MTV2 announced that they will be bringing the show back to life. The premiere was originally scheduled to take place in November 2005, but it was moved to June 10, 2006 so that it could be included in a new block of programming called \"Sic'emation\" alongside two other animated shows, Where My Dogs At and The Adventures of Chico and Guapo. Cuppa Coffee Studios was in charge of producing the show's fifth season, and the premiere attracted in more than 2.5 million viewers, making it the most watched season opener in the history of MTV2's ratings.",

Additionally, there are Drops, which are spherical things that emerge from the planet and can be used to recharge the Monsters. Humans and Dragonoids with the ability to see the Drops can take on the job of Dragon Callers, bonding with monsters. The world is currently undergoing Drop Impacts, which occur when a high number of Drops are formed abruptly in a single region (and can possibly spread), wreaking havoc on the lands and driving the Monsters insane. Indeed, one of Dragon Callers' primary responsibilities is to resolve Drop Impacts through the stabilization of the Drop distribution. Ace is the son of King (a powerful Dragon Caller who mysteriously vanishes at the start of the book), and Rena, who desires to be a Dragon Caller like her father. His journey begins when he begins to see the Drops and discovers an egg of a Tamadra, an almost extinct species, and he relocates to Dragoza, a location that was previously inhabited only by Dragonoids but is now populated by a large number of Dragon Callers. As the book progresses, he develops friendships with Charo and Tiger, as well as a large number of other Dragon Callers, all the while honing his talents and expertise. Additionally, there are the Ancients, who are a hybrid of Dragonoids and Humans and serve as the leaders of Dragoza's six areas. Lance, a Dragonoid and a powerful Dragon Caller, is continually encountering Ace (though not as an opponent) and believes that the Dragonoids will save the Earth. The series is mostly focused on the cause of Drop Impacts; Ace, his pals, and a large number of people are tasked with determining the source of the Drop Impact and attempting to preserve the planet. Meanwhile, they must contend with Dragonoids in Dragoza, who are oppressing Humans, believing that their race should be the only ones allowed in Dragoza, the only ones permitted to be Dragon Callers, and the only ones capable of saving the planet.",

On alternate weeks, viewers could catch new episodes of Marblehead Manor and She's the Sheriff, as well as a rerun of the 1983 sitcom We Got It Made and the drama You Can't Take It With You on the same channel. Three of the shows had low ratings, and only Out of This World was continued for a second season after NBC halted the experiment in 1987-88. It was relocated to weekend time slots after the first season and remained there until the fourth season, when it was cancelled.",

Originally starring Susan Dey as Wally Porter, a Chicago restaurateur, and Jay Thomas as Jack Stein, a sportswriter with whom she had an on-again, off-again relationship, the sitcom was created by Diane English. After the first season, however, the show was revamped and Dey was fired by the show's producers, who said that she and Thomas lacked \"chemistry.\" Annie Potts replaced her as Dana Palladino, who purchased Porter's restaurant and became Jack's love interest. Jack or Wally frequently broke the fourth wall and addressed the camera directly throughout the first season, typically to explain an emotional dilemma. This mechanic was eliminated in subsequent seasons. Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David appeared in one episode as themselves as a \"thank you\" to Diane English for permitting a quick sequence on Murphy Brown in an episode of Seinfeld in which Kramer is cast as the titular character's secretary. Suzie Plakson, Joanna Gleason, Joel Murray, Charles Robinson, and Michael Nouri rounded out the supporting cast. John Hancock, who previously had a recurring role as a judge on L.A. Law alongside Susan Dey, portrayed bartender Ike throughout the first half of the first season until his death from a heart attack in late 1992. His death was subsequently incorporated into the script, and actor Charlie Robinson took his place.",

Series 1 ran from November to December 2008 on BBC One and BBC HD, and series 2 ran from January to February 2010 and ended with a cliffhanger. The BBC said on April 13, 2010, that Survivors was over because not enough people were watching it and other reasons. The first episode of the series aired on BBC Entertainment in South Africa in September 2009, on DTTV's NRJ 12 channel in France on January 12, 2010, and on BBC America in the US on February 13, 2010. The first episode of the show aired in Australia on March 21, 2010, on Channel Nine.",

Dan Schneider was the one who came up with the idea. Initially, production took place at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California; but, beginning with the third season, shooting moved to stages in Valencia, California. In 2005, it was considered for an Emmy in the category of \"Outstanding Children's Program.\" Due to the fact that Zoey 101 was produced entirely on location in Malibu, it was the most expensive production that Nickelodeon has ever undertaken for a television series. Additionally, it was Nickelodeon's best result for a series premiere in almost eight years, making it the network's best performance overall.

The first series of The Tripods, which aired in 1984 and featured 13 half-hour episodes written by Alick Rowe, a well-known creator of many radio plays, covers the first book, The White Mountains; the 12-episode second series covers The City of Gold and Lead. Although a television script for the third series had been completed, it was never produced. The first series was available on VHS and DVD. In March 2009, the BBC published Tripods - The Complete Series 1 & 2 on DVD. The TV series introduced several minor changes from the book, most notably the shape of the Masters and Tripods, which in the book have tentacles; gravity inside the Golden City was artificially increased, which is not mentioned in the TV series; the introduction of \"cognoscs,\" spiritual life-forms vastly superior to the Masters themselves; and more other main characters, including love interests for both Will and Beanpole. Female characters are scarce in the original texts. In an interview with Wordcandy, John Christopher was asked about this, and he responded that at the time of creating the series, it was usually recognized that girls would read books with boy main characters, but not vice versa. He also remarked that the addition of a full family of daughters to the TV show was \"over the top.\" The series is particularly remarkable for its inclusion of non-humanoid aliens, which was unusual at the time.",

In most cases, it was shown on the first Saturday of the month at 7:30 PM, and each presentation lasted for a total of forty-five minutes. There were 133 different shows that were made. Ilja Richter, a German actor and comedian, served as the host of the show. Its predecessor, which was not as well known, was called 4-3-2-1 Hot & Sweet and it was shown on ZDF between the years 1966 and 1970. Some of the presenters on that show included Ilja Richter and Suzanne Doucet. In comparison to ZDF's Hitparade, which catered to an older, more rock-oriented audience, Disco often catered to a younger audience that was more pop-oriented. Up until 1972, its primary opponent was ARD's Beat-Club, followed by Musikladen. After the channel's cancellation on 3sat in 1989, ZDF Musikkanal began airing repeats of Disco in 1984 and has continued to do so up until the present day. Since 2004, the ZDF Theaterkanal, which is broadcast digitally, has been airing repeated episodes of the complete series. Reruns of the series first aired in 2007 on ZDF Dokukanal, beginning with episodes from the year 1975. In 2008, hit24 began airing repeated replays of the series as well. The program mostly focused on chart songs that were recent at the time it was broadcast, devoting roughly the same amount of attention to international pop music as it did to German Schlager. Despite the fact that it was called \"Disco Music,\" it did not concentrate primarily on that genre of music; however, it did play a lot of disco singles as long as they were still chart-relevant.",

Andy Griffith portrays the widower sheriff of the made-up North Carolina town of Mayberry. His life is hampered by an incompetent, but well-intentioned deputy named Barney Fife, a spinster aunt and housekeeper named Aunt Bee, and a brilliant little son named Opie. His life is further complicated by local scoundrels, inept companions, and temperamental girlfriends. Regarding the era of the show, Andy Griffith noted in an interview with Today: \"Well, even though we never said it and even though it was filmed in the 1960s, it had a '30s vibe. We were reminiscent of a bygone era at the moment.\" The sitcom never finished lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and finished its last season at the top spot. According to TV Guide, it is the ninth-best television program in American history. During the eight-season span of the series, neither Griffith nor the show received any honors, although Knotts and Bavier won a combined six Emmys. The show, which originated from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith,\" generated its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telefilm, Return to Mayberry. Due to the show's lasting popularity, there is a great deal of products associated with it. The full series is available on DVD and is presently airing on TV Land.

It didn't take long before it was picked up by other ITV franchises. The lives of the people who live on Coronation Street in Weatherfield, a fictitious neighborhood located in Salford, are the focus of the television show, which revolves around the neighborhood's terraced dwellings, cafe, corner shop, newsagents, textile factory, and the Rovers Return bar. Tony Warren, a local scriptwriter, came up with the idea for the show in 1960 at Granada Television in Manchester, which had only recently been established at the time. The initial idea for a kitchen sink drama made by Warren was turned down by Sidney Bernstein, the creator of the station; nevertheless, producer Harry Elton was successful in convincing Warren to produce the program for a total of thirteen pilot episodes. After its initial airing on the 9th of December in 1960, it quickly rose to the top of the ratings to become the most popular program on British television. It has been one of the most financially lucrative programs on British commercial television, which has been the driving force behind the success of both the Granada Television franchise and the broadcaster ITV. Granada Television uses the Granada Studios in Manchester to produce the long-running soap opera Coronation Street. It is broadcast in each and every ITV region, in addition to being shown abroad. On September 17, 2010, it passed General Hospital as the TV soap opera with the longest production run currently airing anywhere in the globe. The popular British soap opera Coronation Street is renowned for its realistic portrayal of a working-class neighborhood, which it combines with humorous situations and compelling people.",

The plot centres around Darien Fawkes, a criminal facing life in prison who was recruited by a low-rent spy organization and granted the power of invisibility by the implantation of an unique \"Quicksilver gland\" in his head. Fawkes can secrete a light-bending material dubbed \"Quicksilver\" from his pores and follicles thanks to the gland. His skin, hair, nails, and clothes are swiftly coated with the substance, rendering him invisible. He can consciously release the Quicksilver, which then flakes off and disintegrates. However, scientist Arnaud DeFehrn destroyed the Quicksilver gland's production by releasing a neurotoxic that accumulates in the bloodstream and produces tremendous agony, followed by antisocial behavior and psychosis. To keep him sane and healthy, the host requires frequent dosages of \"counteragent,\" which is controlled by said government agency. This sitcom lasted two seasons before being canceled owing to cost difficulties and internal squabbles between Sci Fi Channel and its then-parent company, USA Networks. The first season of the show aired in both first-run syndication and on Sci Fi.",

In the first two seasons, each episode lasted for a total of 30 minutes, but in the third season, it was increased to 45 minutes. BBC Three also broadcast a condensed version of the program that lasted for 15 minutes. This version was shown after the repetitions on Sundays and Fridays, as well as after the repeats of prior seasons that aired in the evenings during the week. Confidential features behind-the-scenes footage on the making of Doctor Who through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew, and other people, including those who have participated in the television series over the years of its existence. It is described as focusing on the human element of the series. Every episode tackles a new subject, and the majority of the time, it alludes to the Doctor Who episode that came before it. There have also been two episodes of Doctor Who Confidential that have been broadcast in addition to the showing of episodes of Doctor Who: in November2006, an edition entitled \"Music and Monsters\" was produced, which went behind the scenes of a televised concert of soundtrack music produced as part of that year's Children in Need appeal, and on January3,2009, a special edition was broadcast to announce the actor who would play the Eleventh Doctor.

Simon Cowell's show premiered in September 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September through December. This program is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames and Simon Cowell's SYCOtv production firm. It is televised on ITV in the United Kingdom and TV3 in Ireland, with a spin-off behind-the-scenes program called The Xtra Factor airing on ITV2. It is the creator of The X Factor franchise on a global scale. The X Factor was created as a successor for the extremely successful Pop Idol, which was put on indefinite hiatus following its second season. Cowell, who served as a judge on Pop Idol, wanted to begin a show for which he controlled the broadcast rights. Later, a legal battle arose over the perceived similarities between the two television programs. The \"X Factor\" in the title refers to the indefinable \"something\" that makes a star. Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, and Louis Walsh were the original judges. In series four, Dannii Minogue joined the panel, and after Osbourne's departure in series five, Cheryl Cole took her place. After the seventh season, both Simon Cowell and Cheryl Cole left to judge the American version of the program, while Kylie Minogue left due to her commitments on Australia's Got Talent. Kelly Rowland, Tulisa Contostavlos, and Gary Barlow then joined Walsh on the judging panel for the eighth season, although Rowland declared she would not be returning for the ninth season, and was replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. In 2013, Osbourne succeeded Contostavlos upon his return. Dermot O'Leary, who replaced Kate Thornton as the show's host in 2007, has hosted the program since 2007. Following the candidates from auditions until the grand finale, the program is divided into a series of phases. During the show's initial televised audition process, candidates sang in an audition room in front of only the judges. Beginning with the sixth season, contestants perform in front of the judges and a live audience on stage. Successful auditionees advance to \"bootcamp\" and then to \"judges' houses,\" where judges filter down the acts in their category to three or four artists to mentor for the live shows, during which the audience votes for their favorite acts based on weekly live performances by the competitors.",

According to the show's pilot, the phrase \"mad men\" was made up by advertisers on Madison Avenue in the 1950s as a way to talk about themselves. The show is mostly about Don Draper, who is the creative director at Sterling Cooper and a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, and the people in his life, both at work and outside of it.

Despite bearing little relation to the original format of the program that was seen in its television debut on November6,1947, it is the longest-running television series in the history of American broadcasting and holds the record for being the longest-running television series overall. Among the various Sunday morning talk shows broadcast on American television, the one with the highest ratings is \"Meet the Press.\" It was first presented by Martha Rountree, who was followed by 10 other moderators. David Gregory is the current host of the show; he has held this position since December of 2008. On May 2, 2010, the show started using a new set, which featured video screens and a library-style set with bookshelves, as well as different and modified intro music, with David Gregory previewing the guests using a large video screen, and with the Meet the Press theme music in a shorter \"modernized [style]... the beginning repeated with drum beats.\" The show debuted with these changes. Interviews with national leaders on problems of politics, economics, foreign policy, and other public concerns are the focus of the television program Meet the Press and other programs with a similar format. The program's typical time slot on the NBC network has been between 9 and 10 a.m. local time in most markets for the past few years. However, the exact time may change from market to market due to commitments that affiliates have made to other programming, such as religious programming, E/I programming, or local news and public affairs programming. The morning coverage of the French Open tennis tournament or the Monaco Grand Prix by NBC Sports also causes it to fluctuate for several weeks during the summer. The program used to be broadcast on Sundays at noon back in the earlier years. A replay of the program may also be seen on MSNBC on Sunday afternoons at 2 p.m. ET and early Monday mornings at 4 a.m. ET. Additionally, NBC's \"All Night\" programming features a repeat of the program at 4 a.m. ET on early Mondays. The program is also broadcast as a part of C-SPAN Radio's rebroadcast of the Sunday morning talk shows. It is syndicated by Dial Global and made available to radio stations around the country.",

        "movie_description": "Those Who Kill is a Danish crime TV series that debuted in 2011 and follows a fictitious squad inside the Copenhagen Police Department that is dedicated to investigating cases of serial murder. In Denmark, each episode of the series was split into two parts, but in most other countries, each episode was longer than a feature film. Denmark was the only country to screen the series in its original format. A standalone feature film with a running time of 92 minutes called Fortidens skygge, which serves as both a continuation and conclusion to the series, had its world premiere in Danish theaters on March 15, 2012. The film is currently being broadcast as the series' sixth and final episode in many other countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany. Elsbeth Egholm and Stefan Jaworski are responsible for the creation of the series as well as the writing of each episode. A number of other screenwriters, such as Siv Rajendram, Rikke De Fine Licht, and Morten Dragsted, contributed to the production of the series by writing individual episodes. Directors have been Birger Larsen, Niels N\u00f8rl\u00f8v and Kasper Barfoed. Co-production companies from Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and Norway worked together to create this series. As a result of declining audience shares after the first few episodes, Danish TV2 decided in October 2011 that there would be no further seasons made of the show, despite the fact that it had been planned to run for several seasons initially and that it was scheduled to run for several seasons. The manager of programming for TV2, Keld Reinicke, remarked that \"We have no intentions to continue the series because it never brought us the audience share that we expected in Denmark.\"",

Television broadcasts of the show began on September 12, 1954, and continued until March 24, 1973. The show was conceived of by producer Robert Maxwell and animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax. The show, which is now considered one of the longest-running on television, originally aired on CBS for a total of seventeen seasons before going into first-run syndication for its final two seasons. The show was initially filmed in black and white, but in 1965, it made the switch to color filming. The first 10 seasons of this television series chronicle Lassie's exploits in a bucolic farming village. Lassie's first human companions are a fictional eleven-year-old boy named Jeff Miller, his mother, and his grandfather. This continues until the fourth season, when Lassie is joined by a seven-year-old boy named Timmy Martin and his adoptive parents. In the eleventh season, as Lassie's antics on the farm come to an end, she joins a series of Rangers from the United States Forest Service and goes on new adventures in the forest with them. Lassie eventually finds a new home at a children's home for her final two seasons of syndication after spending the previous year wandering the country without human leads. The first season of Lassie won two Emmy Awards and earned positive reviews from critics when it originally aired. Emmy nominations have been submitted for stars Jan Clayton and June Lockhart. During the life of the show, a variety of other products such as books, a Halloween costume, apparel, and toys were made as merchandise. The show's longtime sponsor, Campbell's Soup, provided two premiums, of which thousands were given out to the show's loyal followers. In August of 1963, the feature picture Lassie's Great Adventure was released, and it contained an episode that was broken up into multiple parts. Jon Provost, who had previously starred in the television series Lassie, made his return to the medium in the role of Steve McCullough in the 1989 season of The New Lassie. A selection of the episodes has been made available on DVD.",

It was dedicated to impersonating minors and detaining male adults who contacted them for sexual liaisons via the Internet. People were enticed to meet with a decoy under the guise of sexual intercourse, only to be confronted afterwards. In an interview with NPR News, show presenter Chris Hansen explained that these people should be considered potential sexual predators rather than pedophiles. \"People who are interested in prepubescent sex are pedophiles,\" he explained. In November 2004, the series premiered, with a total of 12 investigations taking place around the United States. With the support of online watchdog group Perverted-Justice, the investigations were performed as undercover sting operations. Law enforcement and other officials have been involved since the third installment, resulting in the arrests of the majority of those captured. Since December of 2007, no new episodes have broadcast. To Catch a Predator has been aired locally on the NBC stations WTMJ in Milwaukee, KSHB in Kansas City, and WBRE. To Catch a Con Man, To Catch an ID Thief, To Catch a Car Thief, and To Catch an i-Jacker, all of which featured iPod thieves, were among the many spin-offs that aired in the same format. To Catch a Predator is also broadcast in the United Kingdom on FX and the Crime & Investigation Network, as well as in Australia and New Zealand on the Crime & Investigation Network and in Portugal on FOX Crime.",

Unreal Tournament 2004 and Call of Duty, for example, have episodes that cross over. Teams can also talk about themselves and explain how their team name came to be. In2004, Team ZoMBiE became the Ultimate Arena Champions by winning the Tournament of Champions. In2005, Team Kaizen became the Ultimate Arena Champions by winning the Tournament of Champions. Wil Wheaton and Travis Oates were the show's initial hosts, but both quit owing to issues with the show's producer, Jim Downs, many of which Wheaton revealed in a Slashdot post. Lee Reherman and Michael Louden have taken their place. Reherman and Kevin Pereira were the last hosts. Studio 2 was used to film the first two seasons. Filming moved to Studio3, the largest studio in G4's old headquarters, in 2004 for the show's third and final season. When word of the TechTV buyout spread, the show banked some episodes before being terminated in July 2004 to make way for three former TechTV properties: X-Play, The Screen Savers, and Unscrewed with Martin Sargent.",

Disney said on May 5, 2009, that the show would be back for a second season. Kelly Blatz confirmed on Twitter that the second season started filming on June 22, 2009. In a Live Ustream chat on November 11, 2009, J. P. Manoux, Tania Gunadi, and Bruce Kalish said that Aaron Stone would not be renewed for a third season and that the second season would be its last. The reason that was given was that Disney XD has decided to focus more on live-action shows that are mostly comedies. This news came out before the end of season one in the United States. For the second season, which began on February 24, 2010, 14 episodes were made. The last eight episodes were shown between June 16 and July 30, 2010. Since 2012, Disney XD in the United States hasn't shown any more repeats of Aaron Stone.",

The show is about the two main characters, Ren Hoek, an emotionally unstable chihuahua, and Stimpson J. Cat, a good-natured but dim-witted cat. The show ran for five years on the network. During and after its run, the show was praised by critics and gained a cult following. Some critics say that it paved the way for satirical animated shows like Beavis and Butthead and South Park and played an important role in television animation. Throughout its run, The Ren & Stimpy Show was controversial because of its crude humor, sexual innuendo, and violence, all of which led to fights between the production staff and Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department. Ren & Stimpy's \"Adult Party Cartoon,\" a spin-off for adults, aired on Spike in 2003, but it was canceled soon after it started.",

The series follows the exploits of the title character, Freakazoid, a wild, psychotic superhero who faces a slew of super villains. The show also includes mini-episodes on the exploits of other strange superheroes. Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation collaborated on the project. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation collaborated on the third animated series. With Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs on the air, rumors of Freakazoid! debuting on the Hub Network are circulating. Bruce Timm, best known as a major character in the DC animated universe, intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg asked series producer and writer Tom Ruegger and the Animaniacs team to turn Freakazoid! into a straight-up comedy. The comedy is similar to other Ruegger-led shows such as Animaniacs, and the humor is distinctive in its use of slapstick, fourth wall firings, parody, surreal humor, and pop cultural references.",

Between 1929 and 1947, the story takes place in the fictitious Danish village of Korsbaek. It focuses on the competition between the families of two businessmen: the banker Hans Christian Varns, an established local aristocrat, and the social climber Mads Skjern, who comes in town at the beginning of the series. The series' tentative English title, Matador, was derived from a localized version of the board game Monopoly. In addition, the term \"matador\" is frequently used to denote a business magnate in modern Danish; in the series, it refers to the character Mads Skjern and his entrepreneurial cunning. Matador was conceived by novelist Lise Nrgaard, who co-wrote the majority of the episodes with Karen Smith, Jens Louis Petersen, and Paul Hammerich. The series was directed by renowned Danish filmmaker Erik Balling. The series is one of the most well-known and well-liked examples of Danish television and represents the culmination of the long-term development of Danish television drama by the public service channel Danmarks Radio. The series has become a part of the modern self-understanding of Danes, partly due to its successful blend of melodrama and a distinct warm Danish humour in the depiction of characters, which were portrayed by a wide range of the most popular Danish actors of the time; but also not least because of its accurate depiction of a turbulent Denmark from around the beginning of the Great Depression and through Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark during World War II.",

During this time, Saul faces many challenges as he tries to bring together the 12 Israelite tribes and protect his young nation from the onslaught of vicious enemies. The message that God has given to the prophet Samuel to deliver to King Saul is that he is obligated to wipe out one of Israel's long-standing adversaries. But when Saul disobeys that message, Samuel prophesies that the Lord would take the kingdom of Israel away from Saul and give it to someone else in its place. David, a shepherd, will prove to be Saul's greatest adversary, not the other people he is fighting, as Saul will come to understand over the course of time.",

Beaver's parents, June and Ward Cleaver, were played by Barbara Billingsley and Hugh Beaumont, and Beaver's brother, Wally, was played by Tony Dow. In the US, the show has become an icon, and the Cleavers have come to represent the idealized suburban family of the middle of the 20th century. Writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher came up with the idea for the show. The lives, experiences, and conversations of their own children gave these radio and early TV veterans ideas for the show's characters, plots, and dialogue. Leave It to Beaver was one of the first sitcoms to be written from the point of view of a child. Leave It to Beaver, like many other shows from the late 1950s and early 1960s, shows what it was like to grow up as a white middle-class boy in America. In a typical episode, Beaver would get into some kind of trouble, and then his parents would tell him off and tell him what to do instead. But neither parent knew everything. In fact, the show often showed the parents arguing about how to raise their kids, and some episodes were based on mistakes made by the parents.",

The show follows the lives of two social outcasts who are trapped together in a daily grind in a squalid flat in Hammersmith, London. Richie Richard is socially awkward and sexually inexperienced, and Eddie Hitler is a carefree alcoholic. They have no money, nothing to do, and are sexually dissatisfied, so they spend their days plotting, fighting, and being mean and cruel to one another. They are always poor. Following the completion of the show's initial three series, which were broadcast on BBC Two between the years 1991 and 1995, there were a total of five stage show tours presented all across the United Kingdom between the years 1993 and 2003, as well as a feature film titled Guest House Paradiso. The program is famous for its violent comic slapstick as well as its anarchic and nihilistic sense of humor. In 2008, a poll conducted by the BBC to identify \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" placed Bottom at position number 45 overall. The program is still broadcast in the United Kingdom on the channels Gold and Dave, and it has also been localized into a number of other languages through dubbing. In Spain, the program is referred to as \"La pareja basura,\" and it was broadcast on Canal+. The Bum Notes, a band in whom Edmondson was a member at one point, were the ones responsible for providing the theme song, which is a cover of \"Last Night\" by The Mar-Keys. In 2012, preparations were made for a spin-off series to be shown on the BBC under the name Hooligan's Island. This series would star Richie and Eddie from Bottom. However, Edmondson explained that he wanted to pursue other interests, which led to the cancellation of that project in October of that same year, before to production.",

The series followed up where the direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar left off, with Aladdin now living in the palace and engaged to the beautiful and spirited Princess Jasmine. \"Al\" and Jasmine ventured into danger alongside sorcerers, monsters, robbers, and others. Abu, the animated Magic Carpet, and the quick-witted, shape-shifting Genie all pitched in, as did sarcastic, complaining parrot Iago, originally Jafar's pet but now an antihero. Jafar, who was destroyed in the second film, reappears in only one episode, which also serves as a crossover with Hercules: The Animated Series. With the noteworthy exception of Dan Castellaneta sitting in for Robin Williams in the Genie role, several of the film's performers performed the voices of their TV equivalents. This series, unlike The Little Mermaid spinoff series, does not include any musical sequences. The sitcom originally aired on the syndicated The Disney Afternoon block and on CBS on Saturday mornings.

On July 27, 2007, it was uploaded to YouTube for the first time. The first episodes of seasons two through five of the web series were made available on Xbox Live Marketplace, Zune Marketplace, and MSN Video by Microsoft. After some time, the webisodes were published on the official Guild website, as well as on YouTube and iTunes. According to Day, Microsoft's revenue model shifted after the fifth season; as Day wanted to maintain ownership, he relocated the episode premieres to his channel on YouTube, Geek & Sundry. The webisodes can also be viewed online via streaming services such as Hulu and Netflix, as well as on DVD. The show follows the members of an online gaming guild known as The Knights of Good as they spend countless hours participating in a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game known simply as The Game. The main character of the story is Codex, the Priestess of the guild, who tries to carry on with her life as usual after one of her fellow guild members, the Warlock Zaboo, shows up at her front door. Felicia Day and Joss Whedon both starred in the web series Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, which Joss Whedon acknowledges was somewhat inspired by The Guild. On October 2, 2012, Geek & Sundry broadcast the first episode of the sixth season.

Captain Woody Paris of the Los Angeles Police Department supervised a team of young detectives, and the show focused on his experiences as a leader. Officers Charlie Bogart, Ernesto Villas, and Willie Miller were among the rookie investigators under the command of Sergeant Stacy Erickson. Jerome Bench (Hank Garrett), Paris' supervisor and Lee Chamberlin (Lee Chamberlin), Paris's wife, were featured prominently in the storylines in an unusual turn for police dramas of that era. Paris was also shown to be a part-time criminology lecturer at a nearby university. CBS booked Paris in one of the worst conceivable time slots on a weekly schedule: Saturdays at 10 p.m./9 p.m. Central. Only Hart to Hart on ABC made it past its first 13 weeks of production in the 1979-80 season, when it premiered against the competition on all three networks.

Dick Hickock, age20, is serving time in state prison when he overhears a cellmate talking about a wealthy rancher who hid $10,000 in cash in a safe at his home. When Dick is finally let out on parole, he recruits fellow parolee Perry Smith, who is also 20 years old, to help him find the hidden stockpile. In the middle of the night in November of1959, Dick and Perry broke into the home that Herb Clutter owned in Holcomb, Kansas. They were furious because there was nowhere safe to hide, so they woke up the sleeping family and ruthlessly murdered them all. Two friends who stopped by the house before going to church on Sunday discovered the bodies. The murders stun the inhabitants of the Great Plains town, where it is common practice to walk about with doors unlocked. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation's Detective Alvin Dewey is in charge of the investigation; however, there are no leads, no clear motive, and no suspects in the crime...",

This animated series was created by Canadian David Fine and British Alison Snowden for Toronto-based animation studio Nelvana. It was inspired by the Academy Award-winning short film Bob's Birthday, which won the Best Animated Short Film Oscar in1994, and featured the same characters. The show is one of the few Canadian productions to have received regular airtime in the United States. When it aired in prime time on Global Television in Canada, it was the most watched Canadian-produced animated series in the history of the network. Couple Bob and Margaret Fish, a middle-aged couple without children and two dogs named William and Elizabeth, starred in the show. Margaret is a podiatrist, and Bob is a dentist. Everyday concerns and mid-life crises plague Bob and Margaret. Stories frequently center on the banal, but they do it in a way that is both universal and relatable to the audience. Shopping can be difficult, and they have to put up with pals who are a pain in the neck but owe them dinner. First season Bob and Margaret lived in Balham, a South London neighborhood, for the first two seasons of the show. Third and Fourth Seasons were filmed in Toronto, Canada. This allowed the authors to play with the hilarity of cultural differences. The decision was spurred by the fact that many Canadian tax incentives are conditional on stories taking place in Canada, which prompted the change. In order to maintain the series' financial viability, this change was necessary. The show's creators have chosen to take a more executive role in the final two seasons, evaluating and assisting on scripts but not getting as deeply involved as they were in the previous two. Snowden continued to give Margaret's voice, while Andy Hamilton's voice was replaced by Brian George for Bob's character.",

        "movie_description": "The Hakkenden is an OVA series that was produced by AIC and is split into two parts, with the second part being titled Shinsh. In1999, a continuation of the Shin Hakkenden television series began airing. The epic novel Nans Satomi Hakkenden, which was written by Kyokutei Bakin during the later half of the Edo Period, serves as the inspiration for the anime. The novel has the title of being the longest novel in the canon of traditional Japanese literature, consisting of a total of 106 volumes. The animation of The Hakkenden is particularly noteworthy due to the fact that it employs an unconventional style for the entirety of the series, shifting between a number of different aesthetic approaches. In addition, the series is well-known for the significant amount of symbolic imagery and concepts that it employs throughout its episodes. This helps the series bridge the gap between animation and art. It is also recognized for bringing a contemporary viewpoint to a literary classic. This is due to the fact that it examines and reexamines archaic and morally ambiguous ideas such as feudal loyalty and devotion throughout the course of many of the conflicts that occur in the story. This is one of the reasons why it has become so well-known. The \"THE\" that appears at the beginning of the title is not, in point of fact, a translation formality; rather, it is an actual component of the title written in English. It is possible that the authors of the series chose to include it on purpose so as to purposely give a sense of modernity.",

With the help of his friend Neal James and his dog Lolly, he catches the animals without hurting them and lets them go back into the wild. Most of the show is filmed near Brown's home in Lebanon, Kentucky. At age 7, Brown started catching snapping turtles in ponds near his home. Animal Planet producers heard about him after an episode of Kentucky Educational Television's Kentucky Afield show that showed him catching turtles with his bare hands went viral on YouTube. After network executives went to see Brown in person and did some initial filming, they decided to make a 12-episode season of the show with the working title The Turtleman of Wild Kentucky. Soon after, the title was changed to Call of the Wildman, which is a reference to Brown's unique yell that is used to mark his actions throughout the series. The series was Animal Planet's most-watched show in the fourth quarter of 2011 and was picked up for a second, 16-episode season that started in June 2012.

However, this claim has not been proven. Even though the show had a lot of western elements, King mostly used his plane, the Songbird, to catch criminals and spies and find lost hikers. Even though the planes changed over the course of the show, the last one was still called the Songbird without a number. Near the town of Grover, Arizona, King and his niece Penny lived on the Flying Crown Ranch. Penny and Clipper were also pilots, but they didn't have as much experience as their uncle, so they looked to him for advice and help. Sky put his trust in Penny to fly the Songbird because she was a good air racer and a licensed multi-engine pilot. Penny calls Clipper \"my brother\" in the third TV episode, so they are related.

Rapses' bodyguards Ja-Kal, Rath, Armon, and Nefer-Tina, along with Rapses' cat Kahti, come back from the dead to protect him from Scarab. They turn into powerful guardians by using the power of Ra. Each mummy is linked to the power of a different Egyptian god. Ja-Kal utilizes the falcon spirit, Rath uses the snake spirit, Armon uses the ram spirit, and Nefer-Tina employs the cat spirit. They can call on it to give them magical armor and powers so they can fight superhuman bad guys. But when their strength runs out, they have to sleep in their sarcophagi to get it back. The mummies say \"With the Strength of Ra!\" when they want to use these powers, which causes them to change. The mummies can also make a scary face, which they usually do to scare away people who want to look at them.",

The series, created by Richard Hatem and Michael Petroni, has been described as a \"spiritual equivalent of The X-Files\" by its creators. Following the pilot, Angel co-creator David Greenwalt acted as executive producer and lead writer for the remaining twelve episodes. Miracles follows Paul Callan, a Catholic Church investigator of modern miracles who questions his faith after continually discovering conventional explanations for various alleged incidents. After seeing a true, supernatural miracle that saves his life, only to have his findings ignored due to a lack of evidence, Paul leaves the Church and is asked by Alva Keel to join his organization Sodalitas Quaerito, which investigates and catalogs \"unexplainable\" incidents. Paul and Alva, along with former police officer Evelyn Santos, seek to combat the impending \"darkness\" before it's too late. On January27,2003, the series debuted as part of ABC's new \"Super Monday\" lineup. Six episodes were aired on ABC before the series was canceled due to low ratings, with the final episode attracting only 5.7 million viewers on March31, 2003. Several times during its run, the series was interrupted by rebroadcasts of the documentary special Living with Michael Jackson and newsmagazine specials about the then-developing Iraq War. Fans of Miracles, outraged by the cancellation and what they viewed as ABC's mismanagement of the show's Monday 10:00pm timeslot, launched a fan drive to bring the show back. Fans scribbled messages on napkins and mailed them to several networks in the hopes that the show would be revived by another network, but efforts were futile, and the show did not last beyond its initial order of thirteen episodes.",
